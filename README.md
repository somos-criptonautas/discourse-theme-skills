# Discourse Theme Skills

Claude Code skills for Discourse theme and block component development, bundled with a reference theme that demonstrates the blocks system end-to-end.

## Skills

Two skills are included in `.claude/skills/`:

| Skill                       | Description                                                                                                                               |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `discourse-theme-authoring` | Scaffolding, SCSS architecture, BEM CSS, viewport design, localization, settings, icons, CSS variables, transformers, and theme modifiers |
| `discourse-block-authoring` | The `@block` decorator, plugin API registration, outlets, conditions, container blocks, async data, and testing                           |

### Reference Files

The theme authoring skill links to detailed reference appendices:

- `css-variables.md` — All ~400 CSS custom properties
- `icons.md` — Default icon list, Font Awesome and Lucide
- `transformers.md` — All value and behavior transformers

## Example Theme

The repo itself is a full Discourse theme that demonstrates blocks in practice. It includes a custom homepage, category banners, sidebar blocks, and two color schemes.

### Installation

1. Upload repository root (`discourse-theme-skills`) in **Admin > Customize >
   Themes**.
2. Activate **Discourse Skills** as active site theme.
3. Set site setting `homepage` to `custom` in **Admin > Settings > Basic**.
4. Open `/` or `/custom` while signed in. Signed-in users show default
   Discourse avatar badge in top-right header and homepage right column.

`/custom` is direct custom-homepage route. With `homepage=custom`, Discourse
serves same page from `/`.

`discourse-redditish-theme/` is a separate theme repository included for
reference. Do not upload it as a component of this theme. Homepage badge uses
same current-user avatar pattern; header avatar remains provided by Discourse
core.
